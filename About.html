                    <p>When you have a great story about how your product or service was built to change lives, share
                        it. The "About Us" page is a great place for it to live, too. Good stories humanize your brand,
                        providing context and meaning for your product. What’s more, good stories are sticky -- which
                        means people are more likely to connect with them and pass them on.</p>
                        <br>
                    <p>Yellow Leaf Hammocks tells users about its product by describing how the hammocks empower artisan
                        weavers and their families. The company breaks down different pieces of the story into sections
                        that combine words and easily digestible graphics, painting a picture instead of big chunks of
                        text. They're clear about why they're different: "Not a Charity," the page reads. And then:
                        "This is the basis for a brighter future, built on a hand up, not a handout."</p>
                        <br>
                    <p>Every company has a story to tell, so break out your storytelling skills from that random English
                        class you took years ago and put them to work on your "About Us" page. Using descriptive and
                        emotive copy and gorgeous graphics, an "About Us" page with a story works harder for your
                        business than a generic one.</p>
                        <br>
                    <p>People tend to think that "About Us" pages have to sound formal to gain credibility and trust.
                        But most people find it easier to trust real human beings, rather than a description that sounds
                        like it came from an automaton. Trying to sound too professional on your "About Us" page results
                        in stiff, “safe” copy and design -- the perfect way to make sure your company blends in with the
                        masses.</p>
